# Data Analysis Bootcamp portfolio
  ## Bootcamp portfolio for data analysis
  **Author:** Mykola Ivanochko

Here, you can explore my projects and see my experience of using Data Analysis tools such as:
  - Excel
  - Tableau
  - Power BI
  - MySQL
  - Microsoft Azure/Fabric
  - Python

## Introduction
This repository is created to showcase my projects and practice made during the eight week Data Analysis Bootcamp. Learning new disciplines and methods of Data Analysis I was acknowledging myself with different software tools to produce data analysis using software for data manipulation, visualisation, and extraction.
