# Python. Utilisation of libraries for data retrieval and manipulation
During another week of Data Analysis bootcamp programme , I developed comprehensive Python programming skills with a strong focus on data analysis, manipulation, and visualisation. Working primarily with essential data science libraries, I progressed from fundamental programming concepts to advanced data analytics techniques, building practical capabilities applicable to real world data engineering and analysis scenarios.
