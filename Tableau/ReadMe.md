# Tableau. Visualising data
I developed practical data visualisation skills using Tableau, progressing from understanding platform fundamentals to creating complex, multi layered analytical dashboards. Working with diverse real world datasets spanning employment trends, entertainment analytics, and healthcare indicators, I demonstrated the ability to transform raw data into compelling visual narratives that support strategic decision-making across various organisational contexts.
